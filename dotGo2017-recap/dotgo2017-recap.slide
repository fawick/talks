: Hi my name is ...  / I attended .go last week 
: This talk is meant a very brief overview, meant to raise your interest in learning more about the talk. I cannot live to the real talks, even less so in 20 minutes.
: It's just a Heads Up, Be on the Lookout
: This talk is very last-minute, so links to slides are generally missing. I hope I can add these later.

* dotGo 2017, 6th November 2017

: Fourth issue of dotGo franchise
: Again in this beautiful theatre in the middle of Paris
: 800 attendees, sold out for the first time

.image 26508940519_dcb3bd5850_k.jpg 500 _

: Plush Gophers (!) and "Le Gopher"
: 10 talks and 2 Lightning Talk sessions, 10 Lightning Talks 

: What I really like: dotGo is live: 3 live coding talks (vscode), live sketching (yay!), a lot of breaks, chances to meet, etc.

* dotGo Persistent Resources

Videos:

- All talks have been recorded
- The videos are supposed to hit Youtube next week
- Here's hoping that the interviews will be in the recording
: Usually the videos only contain the talk

Liveblog:
.link https://about.sourcegraph.com/go/ Sourcegraph wrote a liveblog
- Much better recap than this silly 20 minute talk
- More images and code samples
: In the next slides I will introduce the speakers and very briefly summarize what they talked about and what I liked about that talk.

* Sameer Ajmani: "Simulating a Real-World System in Go"

	if err != nil {  // How can these ubiquitous lines be avoided?
		return err 
	}
: John: Polyglot, ruby, haskell
: Humourous!
: How to avoid the ubiquituos three error lines
: Lift the behaviour into a type

* Matt Ryer: "The Art Of Testing"
.image 37573610674_f7d1a29900_k.jpg _ 600

* Bill Kennedy - Behaviors of Channel
.image 38284320481_ad57a61ba3_k.jpg _ 600

: Bill trains Go for a living
: Live coding to illustrate the "drop pattern"
: Used vscode
: Illustrated how program failed if log could not be written

	select { 
	case l.ch <- s:         // I want to write a log string s
	default:                // I cannot move on correctly? 
		fmt.Println("DROP") // Well, than I just ignore this here.
	}


* Lightning Talk Session 1

* Cindy Sridharan: "Unmasking netpoll.go"
.image 38229657746_28321493a1_k.jpg _ 600
- What's under the hood when you `ListenAndServe()`
- Great technical talk with a lot of details
- [[https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/the-method-to-epolls-madness-d9d2d6378642][Blog post 1]] and [[https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/nonblocking-i-o-99948ad7c957][Blog post 2]], [[https://t.co/TARqxOm4er][Slides]]
: Hand-crafted slides looked beautiful
: If you are into the details of networks and system programming, this talk is for you
: Blog entry and slides are available


* Lightning Talk Session 2
.image lightningtalks1.jpg  _ 1000
- Ron Evans: "gocv.io"
- Laurent Leveque: "Using Go on Android and Python"
- Diana Ortega: "Go in Data Science"
- Mickael Remond: "Go for real time streaming architectures"
- Marcel van Lohuizen: "Rethinking errors in Go"
: Android and python: goprotopy tool to generate byndings []byte -> []byte
: Data science: What to use, where to get help (gonum, gopherdata.io)
: Rethinking errors: Yet another error handling packages


* JBD: "Go's Work Stealing Scheduler"
.image 38229672736_2e8d59237f_k.jpg _ 600
- Internals on how goroutines are scheduled over OS threads
- `go tool trace` is the best debug tool for this
: minimize context switches, utilize CPU at the fullest
: runtime prefers to burn CPU cycles instead of preemption
: scheduler is work-stealing, it takes threads from other processors

* Francesc Campoy: "Machine Learning and Go"
.image 37573581494_7a2d7039d3_k.jpg _ 600
- "How to do machine learning in Go, and why not to do it."
: francesc works four sourced now (marchine learning on source code)
: matrix library with non-mutable data structures
: exploiting go concurrency he got faster and faster, a bit similar to sameers talk earlier that day

* Liz Rice: "Debuggers from Scratch"
.image 24413574028_c6c7265b55_k.jpg _ 600
- The queen of livecoding makes complicated stuff appear easy
- She wrote a debugger live on stage [[https://github.com/lizrice/debugger-from-scratch][and published the source]]
: earlier wrote containers in Go in 20 minutes, same goes for syscalls
: Stopping at breakpoints, identifying the current program line, created a backtrace
: by the power of `debug/gosym` 


* Brian Ketelsen: "Preparing for the Next Wave"
.image 38229650546_dfbf4e9d4b_k.jpg _ 600
- Make the ecosystem ready for enterprise developers.
- Create opinionated frameworks to ease their entry
- Announces [[https://gopher.rocks/commons][gopher.rocks/commons]] and [[https://learn-golang.com][learn-golang.com]]
: Most keynote'y talk of the conf IMHO, MUST WATCH FOR ANY JAVA DEV
: "Big companies are making huge investments into Go."
: Developers in companies with tens of thousands employees
: "If you like it or not, the Enterprise Developers are coming."
: Identified where Go is still lacking when compared to .NET and Hava
: Learn-Golang community-translated book, commons library like Apache Commons

* Sam Boyer: "The Functional Design of Dep"
.image 38229674776_14af2b3515_k.jpg _ 600

- Memoization (result caching) to speed things up
- In the case of a dependency manager, cache the results of version solver
: How to apply the Big Picture when designing systems
: IMHO should have come directly after John Cinnamonds talk

* Around the conference

Sunday:

- gobot.io Workshop
- Gathering of Internation Gophers 2

After-show:

- After-show party: O'Sullivans by the mill (again)
- I had a nice chat with some of the speakers
: Mat Ryer, John Cinnamond, Francesc Campoy
: Mat agreed to speak at one of our meetups
: Francesc would do it too, if we ask him nicely.

Tuesday, Wednesday, ...:

- Go workshop with Bill Kennedy
- Women Who Go Paris meetup with Brian and Francesc

* dotGo 2018

Yeah, that's not going to happen. Sorry.

* dotGo 2019

dotConferences is shifting the annual cycle by six months. 

Next issue is *March*25th,*2019*.

You can already register:
.link https://2019.dotgo.eu/ https://2019.dotgo.eu/

Currently the ticket is â‚¬119 (incl. VAT).

: four hours by train from Frankfurt to central Paris (TGV, ICE)
: 98 euros for a first class ticket if you book early (without BahnCard)
: 120 euros 

* Just Go.

It's probably the Go conference closest to Frankfurt. And Paris is even more beautiful in spring, anyway.
